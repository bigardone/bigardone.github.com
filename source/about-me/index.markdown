Hi! My name is Ricardo García and I'm a Computer Engineer with more than 12 years of experience dedicated to the development of web applications from scratch, mainly specialized in Java, PHP, Rails, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (jQuery).

I'm also currently working as a freelance developer, learning, creating and developing collaborative, simple and functional applications using technologies such as Ruby on Rails, CoffeScript, Haml, SASS, and Backbone.

Always in constant search for the balance between development and design, at all times to create a good user experience. Whenever I’m not developing new applications, you can find me riding on any of my different boards, for either sea, snow or just on the boardwalk.

Love & Boards!!!
