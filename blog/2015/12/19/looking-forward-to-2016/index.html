While continuing improving my <strong>Ruby</strong> and <strong>Rails</strong> skills I was already using Facebook&#39;s <strong>React</strong> to code small components for the projects I was working on. This gave me the ability to start creating more and more sophisticated and dynamic UI&#39;s. If your&#39;e into React then you&#39;ll know that the next level is using a <strong>Flux</strong> implementation to manage the state through all of your components. My first choice was <strong>Marty.js</strong> and it changed for ever the way I used to code the views. Instead of creating plain <strong>haml</strong> views and adding some components to them, now I could move all that logic to a <strong>cjsx</strong> view component which made a lot of a more sense.</p> <p>So without even noticing it I was starting to focus my development more and more into the front-end and it&#39;s separation from the back-end. The missing piece of the puzzle was <strong>react-router</strong> and with it I was able to create my first single-page applications, leaving my <strong>Rails</strong> back-ends as mere JSON API&#39;s. If I wanted to make them even more independent I had to stop <strong>Rails</strong> being in charge of managing and building my assets, so I started to use <strong>npm</strong> and <strong>webpack</strong> for this. Now I could install new libraries from the command line and require them where needed. Awesome.</p> <p>Suddenly sad news came, and <strong>Marty&#39;s</strong> development was stopped. But every cloud has a silver lining, and while looking for an alternative I met <strong>Redux</strong>, which was even easier to use than Marty. Rails 5 was also announced, and <strong>ActionCable</strong> was it&#39;s most interesting feature to me. Finally <strong>websockets</strong> on Rails out of the box. But to make them work you need to have at least <strong>Redis</strong> and a multithreaded server like <strong>Puma</strong>, which are dependencies I might not need or want for certain projects and I felt a little upset about the path my favorite framework was following.</p> <p>I have to admit that even though I was very excited about using the front-end stack I&#39;ve been mastering all over the year, I was also starting to get bored and loosing interest on coding back-end stuff using Rails. And this is something I haven&#39;t felt for the last years. But one day <a href="https://twitter.com/hopsor" target=_blank>Victor</a> (thank you bro!), my teammate at <a href="https://diacode.com/" target=_blank>Diacode</a>, told me about the <strong>Elixir</strong> language and the <strong>Phoenix</strong> framework, and a new era has started for me.</p> <p>Now I&#39;m so excited about coding back-end stuff as I was back when I started with <strong>Ruby</strong> and <strong>Rails</strong> five years ago. <strong>Elixir</strong> is a <strong>functional</strong> programming language based on <strong>Erlang</strong> which has a all of it&#39;s benefits like immutability and concurrency with a friendly syntax very similar to Ruby&#39;s one. It&#39;s kind of difficult at the beginning to change your mindset from object oriented programming to functional programming, but once you start to get used to it you feel like it&#39;s even easier and that what happens in the code is also easier to understand.</p> <p><strong>Phoenix</strong> is it&#39;s most popular framework and it not only has the good parts and standards Rails brought to web development, but also some cool features like assets management and building via <strong>npm</strong> and <strong>brunch</strong>/<strong>webpack</strong>, and <strong>websockets</strong> out of the box done right (with no external dependencies or restrictions), you can start coding modern, realtime and functional applications in just a couple of minutes.</p> <p>Right now I&#39;m developing at <a href="https://diacode.com/" target=_blank>Diacode</a> our first <strong>Elixir</strong> and <strong>Phoenix</strong> single-page, realtime application using as front-end stack <strong>npm</strong>, <strong>webpack</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Redux</strong> and <strong>ES6</strong>. If someone had told me this a year ago I wouldn&#39;t have believed it, and I feel like a kid on Christmas day.</p> <p>This is why I love what I do. This is why I love my profession. This is why I&#39;m looking forward to 2016 and I can&#39;t wait to see what it brings.</p> <p>Merry Christmas and Happy New Coding Year!</p> <div id=disqus_thread></div> <script>
